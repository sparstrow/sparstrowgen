# Bugs

Wrong behaviour in the running app — owner-reported or agent-found. Logged in the same turn it
surfaces, because a problem mentioned only in chat does not exist to the next session.

Entries are marked resolved in place, never deleted, so the record survives. Ids are never reused.

Format — keep it to this, no template needed:

```
## B-n — <what is wrong, in one line>
**Found:** <YYYY-MM-DD>, <by whom / during what>   **Status:** open | fixed <date>
**Repro:** <the shortest reliable path to see it>
**Expected / Actual:** <one line each>
**Security:** <only if it is a trust-boundary issue — auth bypass, data crossing users,
a leaked credential. Never paste a live secret or a working exploit payload.>

## B-1 — A long model menu ran off the bottom of the screen, hiding items

**Found:** 2026-09-10, verifying the two-dropdown switcher in a browser **Status:** fixed 2026-09-10
**Repro:** Pick `agy` in the composer's provider dropdown, open the model dropdown. It has 14 entries.
**Expected / Actual:** The whole menu is reachable / it rendered 320px tall from y=605 in a 734px
viewport — bottom edge at 909, so roughly 175px of it sat below the fold with no way to scroll to it.

Cause was mine and worth remembering: `DropdownMenuContent` already caps itself at
`max-h-(--available-height)`, which is what lets Base UI's positioner fit a popup into the space
that actually exists. Passing `className="max-h-80"` overrode that with a fixed height, so the
popup stopped adapting. Fixed by dropping the override and passing `side="top"` on both composer
menus, which are anchored at the bottom of the window. Re-verified at 734px (fits, no scroll needed),
500px (fits), and 360px (caps at 294px and scrolls).

**The general rule:** never set a max-height on a popup. The library is already doing it, and
overriding it converts "fits the screen" into "fixed size, may not fit".
